This standard should be followed when generating clinical trial data that are intended to be submitted to regulatory body (US&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Food and Drug Administration</a>&nbsp;[<strong>FDA</strong>])</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is a drug?</strong></p>
<p>The drug is an exogenous non-nutritive&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">chemical substance&nbsp;</a>which when taken in the solid form by the mouth enter the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>digestive tract</strong></a>&nbsp;and there it is transformed into a solution and passed on to the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>liver</strong></a>&nbsp;where it is chemically altered and finally released into the&nbsp;<strong>blood stream</strong>. And in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blood</a>&nbsp;it exists in two forms:&nbsp;<strong>bound and unbound</strong>. Depending on its specific affinity for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">protein</a>s in the blood (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">albumin</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">globulin</a>s), a proportion of the drug may become bound to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_proteins" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">plasma proteins</a>, with the remainder being unbound. And since the&nbsp;<strong>drug-protein binding</strong>&nbsp;is reversible, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">chemical equilibrium</a>&nbsp;exists between the bound and unbound states, such that:&nbsp;<strong>Protein + drug &harr; Protein-drug complex</strong>. And the bloodstream carries the drug (free plus bound) to the&nbsp;<strong>site of action</strong>. Free drug reversibly bind to the target cell surface receptors. And the Bound drug slowly dissociates from the protein and binds reversibly to the target&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cell surface receptor</a>s to produce its&nbsp;<strong>pharmacological effect</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Drug + Receptor &harr; Drug - Receptor complex &rarr; pharmacological effect</strong></p>
<p>And the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium_constant" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">equilibrium constant&nbsp;</a>for the formation of Drug - Receptor complex is given by:</p>
<p><strong>K = [Drug - Receptor complex] / [Drug] [Receptor]</strong></p>
<p>And K is a measure of how tightly a drug binds to the receptor: The higher the K value the drug bind well to the receptor, the action of the drug will be longer. In general, drugs with higher K values will require lower concentrations to achieve sufficient receptor occupancy to exert an effect. And after its&nbsp;<strong>pharmacological effect</strong>&nbsp;drug slowly detaches from the receptor. And then it is sent to the liver. And there it is transformed into a more water soluble compound called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>metabolite</strong></a>&nbsp;and released from the body through urine, sweat, saliva, and excretory products.</p>

<h2>Phases of Clinical trail</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preclinical research:&nbsp;</strong>In this phase, researchers test the investigational product in the laboratory or in animals before it can be tested in humans. Preclinical results frame the basis for applying an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigational_New_Drug" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>investigational new drug</strong></a>&nbsp;(IND) application to the&nbsp;<strong>Food and Drug Administration</strong>&nbsp;(FDA) to seek permission to use the investigational product in a&nbsp;<strong>Phase I</strong>&nbsp;trial.</li>
<li><strong>Phase I:&nbsp;</strong>In this phase, the investigational product is tested in a 20 to 100 of healthy volunteers who are not at risk for disease to determine the safety and a safe&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>dosage</strong></a>range (maximum concentration of&nbsp;the investigational product above which the investigational product can produce harmful effects in the body), and identify&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">side effect</a>s.</li>
<li><strong>Phase II:&nbsp;</strong>In this phase, the investigational product is tested in a 20 to 300 of unhealthy&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_(disambiguation)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">volunteer</a>s with the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;disease</a>&nbsp;to determine the efficacy [how well&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>investigational product</strong>&nbsp;works compared to a comparator (marketed product or&nbsp;<strong>placebo</strong>)]. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Placebo</strong></a>: a substance that has no&nbsp;<strong>therapeutic effect</strong>&nbsp;but used as a control in testing investigational product).</li>
<li><strong>Phase III:&nbsp;</strong>In this phase, the investigational product&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tested&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,000 - 3,000&nbsp;&nbsp;unhealthy volunteers with the disease (at multiple centers) to confirm the safety, efficacy and side effects of the investigational product. This is the final phase prior to seek marketing approval (or to apply an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Drug_Application" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>new drug (ND) application</strong></a>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<strong>Food and Drug Administration</strong>&nbsp;(FDA) to seek permission to market the product confirming that the investigational product is safe, effective, have&nbsp;<strong>anticipated benefits</strong>&nbsp;that outweigh the foreseeable risks, producible in a consistent quality and purity).</li>
<li>&nbsp;<strong>Phase IV:&nbsp;</strong>post marketing&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">surveillance</a>&nbsp;to understand the risks, benefits, and optimal use of the marketed product.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In order to protect the welfare and well-being of animals used in preclinical studies, the preclinical research is guided by 3 principles:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce the number of usage of&nbsp;<strong>animals</strong>&nbsp;to a minimum.</li>
<li>Replace animal experiments with alternative&nbsp;<strong>non-animal experiments</strong>&nbsp;wherever possible.</li>
<li>Design the experiment in such a way that the adverse effect on the animal is minimized and its welfare is improved.</li>

As part of the verdict, the Court enforced some rules for "<strong>Permissible Medical Experiments</strong>", now known as the "<strong>Nuremberg Code</strong>".</p>
<p>These rules include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voluntary consent.</li>
